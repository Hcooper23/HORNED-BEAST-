## Overview

This is the last class of our Gallery Of Horns. You have horned creatures displaying on the page. When you click on a beast, you increase its favorites and display it as a modal. We will be adding one more piece of functionality: filtering by numbers of horns.

## Feature Tasks

## Feature #1: Display a Modal

## Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want to be able to view the beasts by the number of horns

## What are we going to implement?

- Given that a user is presented with filtering options
- When the user clicks on one option
- Then the images should be filtered accordingly

## How are we implementing it?

- Using the Form component of react-bootstrap, build a drop down menu so that the user can choose to filter by number of horns.
- When the user chooses one of the options, the correct images should be displayed.
